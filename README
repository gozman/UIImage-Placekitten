UIImage+Kitten
--------------

UIImage+Kitten is a fun category on UIImage for grabbing placeholder images from http://placeholder.com or http://placehold.it.

The intent behind this is simply to wrap calls to these web services and help you get cute and useful images in your UI instead of waiting for your designer to provide you with actual resources.

Have fun, the code's provided as-is. You can use it without attribution anywhere you wish - just don't curse my name if something blows up.

>## To use:
> 1. Copy UIImage+Kitten.h and UIImage+Kitten.m into your project
> 2. Include UIImage+Kitten.h in your source file
>
> You can then call:
>
>        UIImage* myImage = [UIImage kittenWidth:640 Height:480];
>
> To get a VGA Kitty :)
